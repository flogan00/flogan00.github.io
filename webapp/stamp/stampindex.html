                    <h4><b>Why was this application made?</h4></b></h4>
                    <p>In April 2024, I (Frankie), finished my master's thesis, "A geospatial analysis of patterns in neighborhood characteristics 
                      and United States professional sports stadium relocations from 1992-2022," with the help of my committe, Dr. Alan Morse and Dr. Chelsie Romulo. While I was doing research, I kept wondering
                      why we keep subsidizing and building professional sports stadiums with little scrutiny, considering how many scholarly articles say that we should be more critical of those stadium projects.
                      I believe that some of the discrepancy is because many research papers are paywalled or difficult to access for people not affiliated with a university.
                      
                      <br><br>
                      As I started transitioning into my 
                      doctoral studies, I began creating this application as a potential solution to creating more research access for those outside of academia. As you play with this application, please email me
                      at franciscologan00@gmail.com if you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions. <b>Your feedback is how this tool can improve!</b>
                      Here are the 
                      objectives of this project:
                      <ol>
                        <li>To create free and unbiased access to information about sports facilities and their potential impacts on communities.</li>
                        <li>To push for more open-access research into sports facilities from journalists, scholars, and citizens.</li>
                        <li>To encourage sport industry practitioners to increase the amount of community agency and involvement that goes into facility construction.</li>
                      </ol>

            <b><h3>About the project</h3></b> 
            The professional sport industry is one of the largest in the United States. With new leagues emerging existing leagues expanding and relocating teams, new professional sports facilities 
            are constantly being built. As the sport industry rapidly tries to meet consumer demands, many of us are left wondering about the consequences of these new sports facilities. When the Oakland 
            Athletics move to Las Vegas, how will it increase demands on limited desert resources, like water? If the Chicago Bears leave Soldier Field, where will they move, and will local residents be priced out 
            of their neighborhoods because of it? When the Arizona Coyotes move to Salt Lake City, how much will they help the economy? Essentially, what impact do these stadiums have on communities?
            <br><br>
            We already have a wealth of information out there to help us answer those questions. Unfortunately, accessing that information can  be difficult, as much of it is paywalled or was not intended to be 
            a tool for community advocacy. This project hopes to make that information more accessible so as many people as possible can learn more about this growing trend and form opinions for themselves.

        <h3><b>Why Barclays Center?</b></h3>
        <p>While this project will include numerous different stadiums and arenas, we chose Barclays Center as our first arena to profile here. Why is that?
          <ul>
            <li><b>Timing:</b> Barclays Center opened in 2012, making it 12 years old as of 2024. It is in the sweet spot of having accessible Census Bureau data of the area before the stadium and after while not being overly impacted by other factors, like the 2008 financial crisis or the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
            <li><b>Documentation:</b> Before and during the arena's construction, it was heavily covered by local journalists, activists, and community members, with articles still available online.</li>
            <li><b>Generalizability:</b> The construction of Barclays Center is generalizable to other stadium situations because it featured many common and unique themes of sports stadium relocation: it's a publicly-subsidized stadium, it was constructed in a metropolitan area, it used <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/eminent_domain" target="_blank">eminent domain</a> to clear land, there were many mixed emotions from community members who were both for and against the stadium.</li>
          </ul>
