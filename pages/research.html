                            <p>As I mentioned before, I am an MMUF fellow, where I conduct research about labor issues 
                            and the analytic revolution, especially as it pertains to youth baseball organizations, specifically 
                            the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), and Little League Baseball (LLB). I am also interested in 
                            neoliberal politics within sports broadcasting from the 1970s to 2020s.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><b>Current projects</b></p>
                            <p>Right now, I am researching pitch count, the worth of pitcher accolades (such as perfect games,
                            no-hitters, complete games, etc.), pitcher health, and capitalism.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><b>Researching style</b></p>
                            <p>I was brought up in my early undergraduate as a classical studies scholar, so archival research is 
                            very much within my wheelhouse, using multi-media sources. I'm moving towards a more sociological style 
                            of research and writing and have been working on an IRB to interview youth baseball players. I'm a firm 
                            believer in academic accessibility, so I do my best to make my presentations and papers as friendly to the 
                            widest audience I can through detailed explanations and references, as well as staying true to my primary goal,
                            which is to be a storyteller first and a scholar second.
