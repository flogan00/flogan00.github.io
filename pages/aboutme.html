                            <p>I am a graduate student at the University of Northern Colorado (UNCO) studying Sport Administration in the School of Sport and Exercise Science. I am a graduate assistant at the Marcus Garvey Cultural Center, and also work for different staff and faculty as a research assistant from time to time. In 2023, I was voted "Most likely to win the Hunger Games" by the Garvey staff, so take that as you will.

                            <p>In life, I want to be an educator and researcher, and work as a consultant to help municipalities implement sport development projects while preserving residential communities and local businesses that might be negatively impacted by the project.</p>
                                
                                </p>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><b>Extracurricular interests</b></p>
                            <p>I'm a really big sports fan, of course. I follow baseball, ice hockey, and motorsports, mostly Formula 1, World Rally Championship, and World Edurance Championship.</p>
                           
                            <p>In my spare time, I love to hike, play video games, read, and work on my beloved car. I also study different languages. I speak, read, and write Czech at an intermediate level, and am beginning my Finnish journey :)
                            </p>
                            <p>My greatest fear is being electrocuted by my car battery and my greatest dream is to be able to pass on my best experiences in sports to everyone I can.</p>
